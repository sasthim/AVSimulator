i had plans on making it a web app but i hate html+css so much i gave up
also tried to make a executable file with customtkinter but gave up in the middle of it cuz why the heck would an .exe be useful

anyway, it was some good practice 

if you want to run it, edit the values for the simulation in the code
i chose to do it this way cuz i find cmd inputing quite boring, even more for testing purposes
