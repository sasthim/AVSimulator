if you want to run it and have no programming experience, here's how to do it:

1. install python 3 (make sure pip and path/environment variable is enabled in the instaler)
2. open the cmd and run the command: 'pip install termcolor' (this will install the library used to change text color)
3. extract and open main.py

if you can't open it by double clicking the file, open a cmd in the app directory and run 'python main.py'
to open a cmd in the correct directory just right click anywhere inside the correct folder, or open the cmd from windows search and use cd <path to folder>



i had plans on making it a web app but i hate html+css so much i gave up
also tried to make a executable file with customtkinter but gave up in the middle of it cuz why the heck would an .exe be useful

anyway, it was some good practice
